Introductory repository to start programming and game development
Developer - Jeremiah B Dempsey (D64988)
  I am the proud developer of nothing as of yet, however I plan to make a career out of game development and design. Game design in particular is something I am quite passionate about, and I am excited to see whether or not I have the metaphorical balls to get into the industry. This is officially my day one, October 30, 2018, so wish me luck. I will assume the pseudonym D64988 for now, but I'll come up with something better later
